\chapter*{Evm Models Equivalence}\label{evm-equiv-intro}

The project's goal is to prove the equivalence between two mathematical models of the EVM.
The mathematical models are Nethermind's \href{https://github.com/nethermindEth/EVMYulLean/}{EvmYul}
and Runtime Verification's \href{https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics}{KEVM}.

Notably, these two models are written in very different languages: EvmYul in
\href{https://lean-lang.org}{Lean 4} and KEVM in \href{https://kframework.org}{K}.
The first step to prove equivalence is to have a framework in which to compare
what the models do, and then show the equivalence of it.

To this end, the K framework allows for the generation of Lean 4 code
representing compiled K definitions.
Hence, the methodology is to show in Lean 4 the equivalence between EvmYul and
the generated Lean 4 code from the KEVM definitions.

This blueprint will (for the time being) only concern about the Lean proofs on
equivalence. For documentation on the more engineering-related topics please
