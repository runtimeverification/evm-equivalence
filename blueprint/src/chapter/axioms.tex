\chapter{Axioms}

We now give a full account of all the axioms / unproven results used
throughout the project.
We can differentiate these axioms in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Code generation axioms: axioms that are needed for the generated code to be well
  behaved
\item Function population: axioms that pose the existence of a function without
  providing an implementation
\item Pre-theorems: axioms that should be turned into theorems
\item Theorem sorries: theorems with absent proofs that should hold
\item Subgoal sorries: subogals that have been sorried-out but are not the most
  critical part of the theorems they belong to
\end{itemize}
